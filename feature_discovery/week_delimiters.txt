following is sample SQL demonstrating how we generate consistent week_ids
note that submissions.submission_timestamp can be replaced with timestamp fields of other tables

SELECT FLOOR((UNIX_TIMESTAMP(submissions.submission_timestamp) 
			- UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2012-03-05 12:00:00')) / (3600 * 24 * 7)) AS week;
