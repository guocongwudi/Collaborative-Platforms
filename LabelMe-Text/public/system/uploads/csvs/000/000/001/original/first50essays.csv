The iMath project will help students by obtaining classroom subject...",My students need four iPods.,"I am a fourth year fifth grade math teacher. The school I teach in is a fifth and sixth grade public school and is a Title One school which means that 95% of our students get free lunch. Presently, I am in the process of completing a Masters degree in Technology in Education through Lesley University. My coursework through Lesley University is allowing me to continue to be a lifelong learner and allow my students to learn in an environment that they can be successful in. Technology has a huge impact on my students' involvement in the classroom. I would like the opportunity to introduce more technology in the classroom, but I need the help of wonderful people like you. \n\nI would like to introduce to my students the program I call iMath. Through the iMath program I would integrate iPods into my math curriculum. It would allow students to practice their math facts, construct projects, create podcasts, listen to tests, and review lessons. iPods would allow my students to learn on their own, with other classmates, or with the entire class. Having iPods in the classroom would not only encourage students to get excited about learning math, it would also make it easier for me to accommodate students who have special needs. This includes having tests read aloud to them or reviewing the day’s lesson played back on the iPod. \n\nStudents continue to struggle with learning their basic facts. As a teacher, I have tried many different ways to help them learn, including using food, manipulatives, and flash cards. I would like to now venture out and try using innovative technology which is what students use every day. Students are used to playing video games and having technology at their finger tips. Unfortunately, I work in a Title One School and don’t have the funds to purchase the desired technology. With your help I could get the technology needed to change my students' minds about how they feel about math. \n\nIt is imperative that teachers bring technology into the classroom, if students are going to be able to survive in the 21st Century. The classroom needs to be ever changing along with the outside world. The iMath project will help students by obtaining classroom subject proficiency through a wide variety of learning methods while using the iPods. According to an Article in iLearn called 21st Century Literacy, “students learn best when they build critical thinking and problem solving skills instead of memorization.” I want to create a 21st century classroom where students learn to become lifelong learners. Your help will help me reach my goals and my students goals."

I teach a wonderful group of 4-5 year old Kindergarten students.  They come in wanting and willing to learn new and exciting things each and every day. I work hard to ensure that my students get the most out of the entire school year. \n\nFor the most part, this is the first academic experiences my students have.  That's why it is vitally important to ensure that they keep the excitement and joy for learning throughout the entire school year and take it with them to first grade.  To ensure this happens, there are certain supplies that every classroom needs. \n\nUnfortunately, with past and present budget cuts, supplies are not readily available.  This makes it increasingly difficult to ensure that my students can continue to be productive and excited about learning day after day.  Chart tablets and markers to write out experience charts, sentence strips for activities and bulletin boards, crayons for art and learning, safety tags for field trips and an electric sharpener will allow my students enjoy learning each and every day. \n\nPlease, I know it takes a special person to donate to a group of children they don't know, especially in these hard economic times, but my students are worth it.  They deserve to have the proper supplies to ensure that their long education gets off to the right start. "

Ideally,...",My students need another iPad to experience technology in the classroom. We have one iPad to service approximately twenty-five students. ,"Have you ever had to crowd around an iPad screen to access information? Students are patient with each other, but patience is just not enough when you want to get an assignment completed. Ideally, all students should have an iPad. Considering my budget, it's a dream . I respectfully request 1 iPad. \n\nMy students attend a K-6 public school in Idaho. They attend intervention to assist them with extra academic support. Their ages range from eight to twelve. These students desperately want to ""catch up"" to their peers, and the approximately twenty-five kids work hard everyday in my class to achieve this goal.  These across grade students are divided into four different sessions by their academic strengths and weaknesses. Literally, all of these children beg to use my personal iPad to access information or use it as an educational tool. I have a schedule for usage because that is the only way I can find a fair avenue to ensure students get exposure to this ideal learning tool. If I had one more iPad to schedule into the day, students could experience this ultimate invention that motivates and engages children more than once a week. There are thousands of applications that will allow students to learn concepts in all areas of our curriculum. Intervention would be even more enriched. \n\nI integrate all areas of our curriculum into reading, writing, speaking, listening and math concepts. For example, if we are studying geometry I will have pairs of students take my iPad and take pictures of angles outdoors where they might see angles in nature or man-made materials.They return and orally record their findings on the iPad, along with their pictures, and present to the class the following day.This process takes a long time for all six in the class to complete, because we only have one iPad.  Many times they are crowded around the iPad to acquire the information they need/want simply because the device is so engaging and concise about the topic. I particularly remember observing them shoulder-to-shoulder watching an animated rap about figurative language. They were crowded, but laughing and grasping the concept far more than by filling out a worksheet. After the viewing they wrote their own very creative rap about metaphors and similes. They were motivated! \n\nEducation is experiencing an exciting shift where we teach depth of knowledge of a subject rather than skim the service of a topic. The new Common Core State Standards have set the bar high for learning. With these high standards a new approach to teaching rich content is critical to engage and motivate students. Technology will be key when addressing these rigorous standards, especially with students who need an extra push. I will use an iPad in my classroom very thoughtfully and responsibly. "

Access to flutes and percussion supplies are in demand in our school music program. Funding is becoming more limited with the current economical environment. \n\nOur school has great kids that love to learn and have fun.  As a Title 1 school, many of our students lack the necessary funds to supply an instrument.  The school provides as many as possible.  Our supply of flutes is very low and adding another would give one more student the opportunity to play in the ensemble.   \n\nBy adding a flute, we will have four flutes for check out.  This will allow one more student a year to choose the flute as their instrument.  The student will develop self-confidence, multitasking ability, setting and reaching goals, self-confidence, and pride.  Percussion supplies will allow us to enrich our music with a broader range of percussive sounds. All percussion items are part of a standard band set-up.   \n\nI believe music is an important part of a well balanced education. I believe every student should be able to participate although they may have financial need.  The more students that have access to music the better for them and our community. "

My proposal is to use the funds to purchase books, audio tapes, cassette players and backpacks for these students to take home on weekends.  They would then be told to listen to the stories with their families, fill in a response form which would be written in English as well as their native language, and then return the resources on Monday.  To further build the literacy component, the students would be asked to share with the class their response form.\n\nListening to a story and reading along with the text is a proven benefit to English language learners.  It builds confidence as the children hear the words pronounced correctly and practiced at home.  The families benefit from spending time together as well as hearing English spoken correctly.\n\nOther benefits of the program include encouraging shared literacy experiences with the families, building vocabulary, listening skills, phonemic awareness, and comprehension as well as building self esteem in beginning readers.

They live in a small community that is very unique.  My students have really enjoyed being in small literature groups this year.  I find them comparing their stories to another groups, as well as trying to check out books from a different group.  As the ear goes on, we are finding it hard to find multiple copies of high interest, grade level complex books. \n\nUsing the set of Roald Dahl books requested, my students will be able to continue their literature groups with enthusiasm.  The quality of their discussion as a result is quite impressive.  Using these materials, I will be able to provide a way to improve student fluency, add rigor to the curriculum, and increase student engagement. \n\nPersonally, I have been in love with literature from a young age.  My live of literature started with the books being requested.  I am choosing these books because I want to see that enthusiasm and curiosity that I remember having as a child after reading Matilda or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the first time in my students.

Anyone who has ever encountered a sixth grader knows how hard it is to entertain and ""hook"" them.  I find that my students become more engaged by reading short novels in a whole class setting.  I also notice their AR goals, the amount of books they read and their reading levels all seem to increase and improve when a great book is shared. \n\nReading impacts all subject areas.

Many of them are reluctant struggling readers and reading selected chapter books as a class will really help me change this. \n\nI service high-risk kids. Many of my students require more motivation than regular students. Most of the students in my class receive free lunch because they come from low income families. Our parental involvement is plentiful but unfortunately most of the parents would be unable to buy their children these chapter books. I don't think that this should deter my students from the wonderful experience of guided whole class chapter book reading they long to have so this is why I am asking for your help. I know this will make a huge difference in their lives and we will truly be grateful for any help you can offer us.  \n\nMy activity will consist of reading the chapter books as a class (altogether, popcorn reading, etc) and actually stopping from section to section to monitor reading comprehension. We will have class discussions about the chapter books we are reading and how we connect to the characters. This will help the students understand that once you can relate to the characters in a story you will be able to better understand them. Doing this will improve their reading comprehension and begin creating a true love for reading. I plan to use the Student Packets for the selected readings to help me understand their acquired knowledge of our readings and as an indicator on how I can better service my kids. I recall being introduced to whole class chapter reading in 4th grade and loving it. I was a struggling English Language Learner reader who disliked reading until that moment in my life. If that helped me create a love for reading I know it will definitely work for my kids! \n\nI remember being that struggling reading student in the class. If it weren't for my fourth grade teacher introducing chapter book reading to me I highly doubt I would have become the passionate proficient reader I am today. Mrs.Clark changed my life and inspired me to become a teacher. This is why I need your help. I can't do it alone! Our school is under strict budgetary constraints and this would really help us provide our kids the education they deserve. Thank you for your time. "

The American Academy of Pediatrics calls cyber bullying ""the most common online risk for all teens.""  \n\nBullying is not a new problem. While bullying has long been an issue among teens, the use of computers and smart phones to send rumors or post cruel messages has made it possible for bullying to extend beyond the school yard and reach students in the safety of their own homes. Even though physical injuries may not be present, cyber bullying leaves deep emotional scars on the victim. \n\nCyber bullied students may appear sad, moody, or anxious; may avoid coming to school; withdraw from social activities; experience a drop in grades; or fear using a computer. In extreme cases, online bullying can drive a child or teen to deep depression and even suicide. Since 1983, over 150 teen suicides have been linked, in part, to the pressure of cyber bullying. \n\nI am the media specialist in a rural, Title I K-12 school in Alabama. Many of the discipline problems our teachers and administrators face are a result of something that started on Facebook or Twitter the night before. \n \n\nWe are looking at this severe problem within our school and taking steps to educate our students on this issue. One excellent tool that we would like to utilize is the Teen Cybersmarts Program. Teen Cybersmarts is an interactive eBook program which simulates a real-life Internet experience within the safety of an instructional, guided, and fun platform. The goal of Teen Cybersmarts is to ""create savvy cyber-citizens who don't fear the Internet, but can make informed and sophisticated decisions every time they sign on."" Teen Cybersmarts shows users how to deal with online bullying, including how to respond to or ignore a bully and where to turn for help. To implement this program, we must have an eBook Reader. We are asking you to consider a donation toward an Apple iPad so that we may project our online program onto our whiteboard for whole-class discussion.  \n\nIn an era where so much of our communication exists online, it is easy for teens to feel invulnerable and forget the risks associated with interacting online. Thank you so much for considering our project. In a time where education funding has been on the chopping block, it is only because of generous donors like you that my students have the tools they need to succeed. Donors Choose has made such a difference in my classroom. Thank you for believing in my students as much as I do. "

My students are, for the most part, typical inner city children with little experience of the world outside their own neighborhood.  Many are underprivileged and classed as ""at risk"" students.  We serve a student population that is changing rapidly.  Our current student population is approximately 70% African American and 30% Hispanic. Many students are the first in their family that have the opportunity to  attend college. Our students are eager to learn, work hard, and consistently score well on state exams. \n\nAs stated, many of my students have little concept or experience of the world outside their neighborhood.  In allowing them easier access to explore such interactive sites as Google Earth, the Smithsonian, the British Museum, I  forsee an increase in knowledge of our own and other cultures.  Recently, as a class, we accessed the Egyptian Room in the British Museum and the students were fascinated and eager to learn more, but with our limited technology resources we could not explore further.   Tablets would allow our student to really explore the entire world. \n\nGiving students the opportunity to understand their own history and culture and the history and cultures of other lands is important in today's increasingly global society.  In giving students access to technology, it will give them the ability to explore the boundaries of the world  in which we live and make them more rounded and knowleagable students. "

The arts are a great way for them to learn how to focus their attention and learn bodily control.  They attend a special area for dance, drama, and can sign up for a weekly strings class.  Even in the primary grades, there is a push for stage presence and performance, so what better way to have them adapt to seeing themselves than to use a video camera?  My students are very urban and love watching television shows like Hannah Montana and I-Carly, where they see how technology is used to promote a specific ""look.""

I also want to use the camera as a means of communication to another class in Japan that we will be writing letters to throughout the year.  The equipment I am requesting would allow us to broadcast via Internet.  Lastly, I want to use the camera to record group activities in which my students are presenting a project or idea.  All of these activities will give us instant feedback that we can review for assessment in our communication skills. \n\nAs my young students become aware of their surroundings, they will learn how they appear to others.  Communication is important, whether in a small or large group, and my students need to learn how to take turns and use positive body language.  Are they giving everyone in their group a turn?  Are they speaking too softly or loudly?  Are they making eye contact with each other and paying attention to the leader?  A video camera can help assess in all of these areas. "

Getting a head start in financial literacy may have saved me a lot of interest payments as I navigated my way through adult money matters. \n\nI will be working with a very bright, motivated and curious class in the fall. With their motivation and curiosity naturally comes an independent spirit, and the need to express themselves. Those independent expressions often come at inappropriate times, such as when walking though the hallways, on a fire drill or during quiet, independent work time. Rather than discouraging their self expression, I would like to help them channel it into class appropriate creativity, as well as learn how to self monitor for correct, appropriate behaviors. \n\nI am designing a system for classroom rewards, based on a financial literacy theme. My idea is to ""pay"" the students in ""GOOD"" money for positive behaviors or classroom achievements. Many teachers use stars or stickers to recognize these appropriate behaviors. I will use the color printer to create the ""GOOD"" dollars, which they earn for various behaviors. I will also work with them to create various store posters, such as a shopping list, a price list and leaderboard, to track their savings, wish lists and progress. We will display these on the new corkboard. The items such as stickers, crayons and paints will be our inventory. They will be able to save their money for a larger purchase (such as the glitter pens) or use their money sooner for a smaller purchase (like a single Smencil). They will also be subject to having to pay a fine for repeated inappropriate behavior, whereas they may lose part of their savings. \n\nMost people learn life skills by being immersed in them. I am planning on teaching my students financial literacy and appropriate behaviors by immersing them in it each and everyday. By using a motivating, colorful and interesting technique combining positive behavior reinforcement and taking responsibility for their own actions, I know that they will learn to be good savers, be financially literate and continue to work towards being good school citizens.

It is that simple, but harder to carry out than you think. Especially for children who come from homes without books. My students need fantastic books, written for beginning readers.  They need over 100 apiece in their first year of school. \n\nThese kindergarten students attend an urban/suburban Title I school in Virginia. They come from 50 countries and speak a dozen languages. Many are eligible for free or reduced lunches and come from homes where reading isn't a common activity. Many of their parents don't speak English; some are illiterate. These five-year-olds often haven't attended preschool and start the year ignorant of the alphabet, or how to write their own name. Yet by the end of kindergarten, they have to know how to read and write, or with every passing year they will fall further behind their peers. I am a literacy teacher. My job is to make sure they know how to read and write by June. One of the ways I do this is to expose them to as many wonderful books as possible so that they will not only know how to read, they will love to read. \n\nImagine a room of 5 year olds sitting or lying on the floor, filling the room with a quiet buzz, whispering words to themselves or each other. Beside each is a box of books they've chosen to read and reread this week. The critical element in this picture is the books, 160 of them at a minimum of 8 per child. Multiply that number and you get the idea how many books are needed to keep these children motivated and learning. Buying high quality books costs more money than kindergarten teachers can be expected to spend. Although we work in a generous school district, the budget does not include books for independent reading. The 8 sets of leveled books I am requesting are full of colorful pictures, fun characters, and great details. They include stories or facts, written in simple language early readers can read independently. Although these books are little, they are expensive. Helping a child become a skillful reader early on is worth every penny. \n\nKindergarten no longer is a time to play dress up or color pictures.  Today's students have to learn to read, write and do math. If they fall behind in kindergarten, they will already be struggling readers in first grade, and probably in the years to come. Help my kindergartners stay on track and feel good about themselves as learners with great books they will love. If we can catch them early, we will have helped them for life. "

Most families fall below the poverty line. Some of our families live with other families. We have one family that rents the dining room of an apartment because that is all they can afford. Despite their life trials, we teach beautiful and happy children. They appreciate everything. Most of them are learning English, while learning the curriculum.

We have become seasoned in using resources, such as donorschoose.org, to provide for our students. We spend a great deal of personal time trying to accommodate our families with basic needs, such as food, clothing, coats, etc. Sometimes we forget the simplest things children need: like crayons, art, and creativity. \n\nMy high school-aged son is collecting used and broken crayons, and crayon bits, that would normally be trashed. He bought different molds and plans to melt the crayons to create new crayons for our younger students. He has spent much time collecting, sorting and unwrapping the crayons. Once melted, the old crayons will be poured into molds to give them new life. In addition to fun shaped crayons, my son plans on making kaleidoscope crayons, too. We are requesting pencil cases to hold these crayons so they can be distributed in nice packaging. I also am requesting iron-on transfers so we can make a label for these cases. The crayons will be distributed to Kindergarten students in the school where I teach.\n\nMy son hopes that providing these fun crayons will help feed a hunger in young creative souls. It will provide these children with something fun to do, at playtime, since it is so dangerous outside their homes and our school doors in this community. \n\nThe students will be able to reconnect with some of the cultural vibrancy they left in their native countries.

They love reading about American history from different perspectives that are closely aligned with their own as native born and immigrant children of color. \n\nMy students are from an urban city in California. Their community was economically depressed long before the current economic downturn that is currently facing our country and will likely continue to be economically depressed after the county recovers from the current recession.

That being said, my students see our school as a gem in their community and come to school each day as scholars who believe that they are capable of accomplishing anything. We were 1 of 2 schools in our very large district to substantially raise our test scores on 2010-2011 state test. We are not a school community with a lot of economic resources, but we do a lot with what we have. I have made it my mission to bring as many excellent resources and experiences to my students as possible with the goal of making their educational experience as rich as possible. \n\nLast year I had great results with using Zinn's book in combination with other U.S and California history books as the bulk of my reading and social studies programs. My experience using A Young People's History of the United States is that it was an excellent resource. I saw my students forming an understanding of themes in U.S. history that they could not get from a textbook. I also saw real growth in their ability to read, discuss and understand a nonfiction texts. As importantly, several students who previously had no interest in history at all, began to see themselves as historians and to love history. \n\nIf I am unable to get a class set of these books through donations, I will not be able to use this book this year, because we don't have a reliable photocopier at our school.  I would hate for my students to miss out on this valuable resource. Please support me in helping my students become scholars and historians. "

They attend a college-preparatory charter middle school. They have an extended school day and an extended school year. They are taught the California state standards through a vigorous and rounded curriculum. Every student takes math, science, ELA, history, PE, orchestra and a college-prep class. Our students come to school to an open and caring environment. \n\nWe strive to meet the needs of all our students. Within my class, I teach a variety of students: learning disabilities, ADD, ADHD, Autism, and English language learners. Also, some if not all of these students are highly energetic, anxious, or stressed out. When they ""act out,"" or are not paying attention, they end up in trouble but, it doesn't have to be this way: they deserve more.\n\nFidget toys are both effective at helping the student to concentrate and can easily fit into the classroom environment. These toys are small, quiet, and are able to be used without distracting others.  \n\nStudents can use these toys to concentrate during a lesson, a silent or independent activity, or a test. \n\nThese students will become empowered by the opportunity to practice self-control, thus, developing a positive self-image and positive self-esteem. This will be evident in their classroom behavior and their academic performance.\n\nInvesting in fidget toys will improve the quality of education for all students. "

Think about it as a picture of our past strongly anchored by our emotional memories. We use these pictures of our past to adapt the way we do things now. Those with autism don't have the ability to readily pull from their past to help them think about how to do things differently today or to help them remember what the most important part of the memory was supposed to be. Slowly, with these photos, I can teach ASD students to pull from past experiences in order remember what they have learned! \n\nYour donation will have a great impact on my classroom!

Some of my students will see themselves, their families, and/or their friends in this book.  Others will grow in their knowledge of a different culture and begin to understand what it is like to be part of a culturally diverse community. \n\nMy students will be able experience a different culture through this realistic fiction novel.  They will learn about what life is like outside their own experiences and hopefully make text to self connections that will broaden their understanding of the world. "

The children are absolutely captivated with all things Colonial, from the Boston Tea Party to the Culper Spy Ring! \n\nMy class of seventeen students are 4th Graders.  They  attend a public school, grades K-12, on the beautiful North Fork of Long Island, in New York.  They are avid readers, curious learners, and have a great interest in history, and the world around them. \n\nWith a set of books on the Colonial Era in our classroom, I will be able to greatly extend the learning experiences of my children.  Their interest in this topic inspires me to keep providing more material for them.   I am hoping, through your generous support, to give them resources that will further their knowledge of this subject, and honor their love of learning of American history. \n\nWith your help, we can foster the children's interest in American History.  This can only be a benefit to them as they grow to be productive citizens. With many thanks for your consideration of my project. "

","Do you remember losing something and not being able to find it? My students need to be organized in order to start off their school year. \n\nMy students attend a school that teaches PreK-6th grade, with two classes for each grade level. They are in 3rd grade and love to learn. Staying organized tends to be a challenge. They love to participate in learning and have a great sense of humor. We love to have fun!  \n\nMost of my students need specific instructions when I ask them to do a task. With colored folders and notebooks, they can easily pull out the folder I am asking them to. With highlighters, they will be able to read with enjoyment and answer questions for a Reading Review, daily. Pencils are a necessity in school. With close to 30 students, pencils are quickly gone. These pencils will allow students to always do their work. The Writing Books will allow me to teach with accuracy and teach to their specific needs. Finally, the chair organizers will allow students to organize their folders and books, with easy access.  \n\nThank you for considering a donation! Remember that these children need these basic supplies to guarantee a successful school year from the start. Not only will students be able to stay organized, but they will have fun at the same time!  "
